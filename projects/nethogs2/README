proctab parses /proc for inode->process info, and endpoint info to inode mappings
pktanal strips packet headers and returns the useful info found in each layer (messy), eg IP stuff from layer3, and ports from layer4
nethogs2 glues the bits together with an ncurses interface. it also eats packets from libpcap. not of particular interest to casual
viewers, with the exception of how i deal with libpcap, and make it DoStuffFastAndGood in DeviceCapture.
