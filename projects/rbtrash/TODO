* The trash action is probably best suited in a placeholder "TrackControlPlaceholder" placed around the "Control{Previous,Next}" actions in "plugins/status-icon/status-icon-ui.xml:/ui/RhythmboxIndicator".
* Either merge the action and its behaviour into the status-icon plugin, or create a dependency on it that will prevent activation without it loaded, deactivate it if it's unloaded, and ensure that the trash action is placed in the correct position in the menu.
