This directory contains code for completing COMP3320 assignment 2
on fremont. You have the following 5 files

Makefile, cloth.h, mycloth.c, opengl_stuff.c, testcloth.o

Type make and you should two executables
  testcloth
  mycloth

Run testcloth
	./testcloth
and it should perform the cloth simulation opening a OpenGL graphics 
window. You can change various input options. To see these do
	./testcloth -h

You have only been provided with a compiled copy of testcloth.o. Your
first job is to write C code, equivalent to what is in testcloth.c, but
in the file mycloth.c. If you look in this file you will find a
reasonable outline of what you need to do. You should be able to construct
the C code using this guide and the full python code you have already
been given.

Note that writing mycloth.c and reproducing testcloth is just the
initial part of the assignment. The second objective will be to parallelise
this code using openmp and analyse the performance. If you find
you are having problems creating mycloth.c - you MUST COME AND SEE ME.
Don't spend more than 5 hours trying to do this.
