#summary About EruBot, helper program for Tibia.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

EruBot was actively developed from early 2005, until November 2006. It is *no longer maintained*. This means the source code still exists, but no updates have been made since Tibia 7.81.

= Source Code =

EruBot is primarily written in VB (shame), with some auxiliary code in C. If I were to write it again I'd do it purely in C or C++, with some assembler.

EruBot could be updated for the latest version, memory addresses and struct member offsets are all stored as constants. Modifications to these, and any changes to packets can be done in the appropriate places in the code. You're welcome to do this, and submit a patch back if you so desire.

= Capabilities =

At it's height, just before I stopped maintaining EruBot, it had the following:
 * cavebot (waypoint system, with intelligent target selection)
 * auto healer (wth a macro system for who to heal, when and with priorities)
 * lock-on attack (great for knights on stairs ;D)
 * built-in magebomb synchronization
 * light (full light, no glitches)
 * experience (ETA at current experience rate)
 * skill progression monitoring (you'd be notified every 1%, with an ETA to next skill point rise)

In reponse to some questions about other capabilities, as far as I understand these new terms, EruBot did not have the following:
 * Dash
 * Attack combo (for more than just the current player)

_*This page is a work in progress*_.

Please remember there is *THERE IS NO CURRENT VERSION*.
